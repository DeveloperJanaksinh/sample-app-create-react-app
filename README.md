# sample-app-create-react-app
Sample app generated by running create-react-app.

Lot of time new developers who start on react or front end developers (like me) try to generate simple app using following command, runs into issues due to varios reasons, wether firewall or network or node / npm / nvm issues and end up spending lot of time before they get to simple start.

npx create-react-app <anyname>
